**Effective Date:** [Date]  
**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Introduction

CleanRead ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles information when you use our service.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

CleanRead is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do **NOT** collect, store, or transmit any of the following:

- Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Browsing history or website data
- Text content from web pages
- User preferences or settings (stored locally only)
- Device information
- Location data
- Any other personal or sensitive information

## How CleanRead Works

CleanRead operates entirely locally on your device:

### Local Processing Only
- All font and formatting changes happen in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- No network requests are made for functionality
- All processing occurs on your device

### Local Storage
- Your settings and preferences are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's local storage
- This data never leaves your device
- You can clear this data at any time through your browser settings

### No Data Transmission
- We do not transmit any information to our servers
- We do not share data with third parties
- We do not use analytics or tracking services
- We do not collect usage statistics

## Permissions Explained

CleanRead requests minimal permissions necessary for functionality:

### Required Permissions
- **Storage**: To save your font preferences locally on your device

## Third-Party Services

CleanRead does not integrate with any third-party services that collect data. The fonts used (OpenDyslexic and Lexend) are loaded locally from the extension and do not involve external data collection.

## Data Security

Since we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your information. All functionality happens locally on your device.
